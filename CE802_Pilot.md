# The task ahead of us

It's clear that the problem that we're facing is a supervised problem, as we have in our power historical data that we can use to create the models. Thus, we the problem is either a classification or a regression problem. To know this we just have to notice that we're not looking into a specific numeric value, but instead we're looking for discrete values to determine if the client will file a claim on their travel or not. Therefore the predictive task has to be a classification problem, because we're only concerned of the discrete values.

# Features that may be useful

Considering that we can know everything of the client that is asking for the insurance I believe that the following features could be very useful to be able to create a better model

- _Travel destination location_. This feature is important because there are some travel destinations that exist a higher chance of something going wrong, mainly because of crime but it can also be due to bad weather conditions in certain dates.
- _Start of travel month_. The month the client will be traveling to the destination, this could help to detect possible cases of filing claims due to damage caused by weather conditions.
- _Travel length_ (How much time the client will be traveling). Longer travels normally leads to having a higher chance of something happening, thus increasing the chance of filing a claim
- _Insurance history_ (There were any previous claims that client has filed?). If the person has previously filed claims may be because they're constantly putting themselves in dangerous scenarios.
- _Age_. Mainly based on the idea that younger people are more inclined to more dangerous activities specially if they're traveling for pleasure
- _Type of insurance_ (or how much is the insurance). If the insurance company provides different type of insurances it may be possible to know which is the type is more common to file a claim
- _Business travel?_ A business travel may be safer and less probable to file a claim.
- _Rating of the hotel expected to be hosted_. A lower rating may be due to having a more hazardous environment inside and/or outside the hotel

# Learning procedures

To be able to create the model there are some possible learning procedures we can choose, these are the recommended:

- Decision Trees
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- SVMs
- Classification Neural Networks

# Evaluate the performance of the system

To evaluate the performance of the system we'll first divide our dataset 70-30 (70% for training and 30% for testing). Using this splits it will be used the testing dataset to evaluate using a metric to determine the performance of the model trained with the training dataset. This metric can be either of this:

- Accuracy (Check how many times the classifier predicted correctly), using this metric we should then look for having the **bigger** accuracy possible
- Categorical Cross-Entropy (A loss function specific for classification problems), using this metric we should then look for having the **smaller** loss possible

In this case I recommend to use the accuracy, as it's easier for everyone to understand what the metric is and why having a bigger accuracy means a higher performance
